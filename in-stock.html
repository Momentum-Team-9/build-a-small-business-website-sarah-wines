        <h2>Wild Hyacinth</h2>

        <p>
          This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in
          well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest
          areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies.
          Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The
          plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs
          should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by
          seed rather than by runners.

        <h2>Lily-of-the-Valley</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/lily-of-the-valley.jpg" />
        <p>
          With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle
          above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade
          lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty
          plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and
          anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial
          to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well. **Warning: this
          plant is poisonous.**
